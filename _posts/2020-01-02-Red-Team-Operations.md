## Red Team Operations
How do you know if your blue-team or SOC (Security Operations Centre) team are really ready to detect, respond and stop to a targeted attack?

Our comprehensive Red Team Operations mimic modern hostile techniques of key threat actors such as organized crime groups, state-sponsored attackers, cyber terrorists, spies to comprehensively test your organization's ability to handle an advanced bespoke attack.
