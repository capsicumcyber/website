## Application Security & Penetration Testing
Pentesting is an ethical hacking activity that is a cybersecurity assessment designed to detect and use security vulnerabilities that affect servers, networks, systems, and applications. Thus, any detected vulnerabilities can be eliminated, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to malicious attacks.

Our experts specialize in manual penetration testing services for web applications, APIs, Mobile Apps (iOS/Android), Desktop Apps, WiFi, and internal/external networks and have well-known technical certificates for Penetration Testing. 

We have more than 100 corporate references, including finance, automotive, telecommunications, healthcare and defense companies.
