## Adversary Simulation
If your security devices, appliances, and processes are not properly configured, security breaches or cyberattacks may not be detected and prevented quickly.

Our Adversary Simulation service measures how well your defensive prevention activities can detect and respond to a real-world attack using the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as cybercriminals.
