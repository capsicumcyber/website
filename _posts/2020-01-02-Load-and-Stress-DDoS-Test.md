## Load & Stress (DDoS) Test
We can simulate a single user behaviour from a single browser, with more than 1 million users in real web browsers, to test the strength of the infrastructure and response time of your applications.

We also have a DDoS testing platform designed to assess your organization's readiness for various DDoS attack scenarios.
